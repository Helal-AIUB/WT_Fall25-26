Project Description
The primary purpose of the City Corporation e-Service Portal is to digitize and streamline the delivery of essential municipal services. Traditionally, obtaining documents like trade licenses, NID corrections, or water connections requires physical visits to government offices, resulting in long waiting times and bureaucratic inefficiencies. This project aims to eliminate these barriers by providing a centralized online platform where citizens can access these services from their homes, ensuring transparency, speed, and accountability in public administration.

Project Overview: This web-based application functions as a bridge between citizens and city officials. The system is built using a secure MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to ensure data integrity and smooth performance.
                         •	For Citizens: It allows users to register, apply for services (Trade License, NID Correction, Water Connection), update profile information, upload profile picture, track application                                             status in real-time, pay fees digitally, and download official certificates upon approval.
                         •	For Officials: It provides a comprehensive administrative dashboard to review applications, verify submitted data, and approve or reject requests with just a few clicks. The system                                                automates fee calculation and certificate generation, significantly reducing manual workload.
